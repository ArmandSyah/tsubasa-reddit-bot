## Tsubasa Reddit Bot

My little pet project, Tsubasa, is a Work-In-Progress Reddit Bot designed to look up info on an anime (names, source,
synopsis, ect.) for you and display it through a neat and tidy reddit message. So far, all the modules related to scrapping
info have been completed and the next step is to make the reddit interface to interact witht the user

## Requirements

* Python 3.5+
* BeautifulSoup4
* Requests
* PRAW 

### Big TODOS

* ~~Finish Scrapping Anime Info and websites~~
* Add Reddit Interface
* Create SQLite DB to reduce page requests

### Thats all for now, I'll keep working on this and hopefully it'll be great!
